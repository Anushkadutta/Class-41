# Class-41 

What we did:

    1) We revised the concepts (Variables, Numbers, String, Booleans, Array, Functions, Objects etc.)covered in the class till date.

    2) We used the console to run Javascript Commands.

How we did it:

    1) We recalled the different commands and variables used in the class activities till date: 

      a. Pong: Variables, storing numbers, strings, conditional programming (if-else), for loop, functions, game state etc.

      b. TRex: Creating infinitely scrolling ground, arrays, switch statement, library, writing own library, DRY etc.

      c. Angry Birds: Classes, objects, physics engine, calling an API , Code Readability, Writing structured code etc.

      d. Car Racing Game: Databases, reading and writing to a database etc.

    2) We reviewed the different concepts by writing code in the JS console. As soon as one writes a command here and press enter, one can see the output for the program.

    3) We reviewed the following topics in javascript:

      a. Declaration and use of variables

      b. Arithmetic operators

      c. Different data types

      d. Conditional programming

      e. Loops
